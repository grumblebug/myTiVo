This project has different color schemes to change the look of the pyTivo web interface. Choose one to match the look and feel of your TiVo or just one which pleases your eye. 

To use a different color scheme, copy one of the following .css files on top of main.css

   daybreak.css
   dusk.css
   forest.css
   midnight.css
   steel.css
   sunset.css
   sunshine.css

For example, to use steel instead of the default (midnight) you could use the following command on Linux:

   cp steel.css main.css

Symbolic links may also work but they've not been tested.


On Windows, etc... you can use the UI to copy the desired scheme to main.css


Color scheme changes are based entirely on CSS and will take effect immediately upon page load.
